# 🧠 AI-Driven Multimodal ADHD Screening & Attention Enhancement Platform

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project presents an **AI-driven, multimodal ADHD screening and attention enhancement platform** designed for **children aged 6–10**, with a strong focus on **Sri Lankan and Sinhala-speaking contexts**.

The system integrates **speech analysis**, **handwriting assessment**, **body posture and hyperactivity tracking**, and **eye-tracking–based visual attention analysis** to provide an **objective, scalable, and non-invasive ADHD screening solution**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**  
> This system is intended for **SCREENING purposes only** and **does not provide a medical diagnosis**.  
> Results must be interpreted by qualified healthcare professionals.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional ADHD diagnosis relies heavily on:
- Lengthy clinical interviews  
- Subjective behavioral observations  
- Expensive and inaccessible tools (e.g., EEG, lab-grade eye trackers)  

These approaches are often:
- Time-consuming  
- Costly  
- Difficult to scale for schools and community settings  
- Not child-friendly  

As a result, there is a **critical need for an accessible, engaging, and objective ADHD screening solution**, particularly in **resource-limited regions such as Sri Lanka**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a **multimodal AI-based ADHD screening framework**
- Enable **early identification** using non-invasive behavioral data
- Support **Sinhala-speaking children** through culturally adapted tasks
- Integrate **screening and attention enhancement** within a single platform
- Ensure **privacy, ethical compliance, and child-friendly interaction**

## 📝 Project Description

This project proposes an AI-driven, multimodal screening platform to support the **early identification of ADHD-related behavioral patterns** in children aged **6–10 years**.  

Multiple non-invasive data sources—including **speech**, **handwriting**, **posture**, and **eye-tracking**—are combined to generate an objective ADHD risk assessment and to recommend appropriate attention improvement activities.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The platform follows a **modular, service-oriented architecture**, where each behavioral analysis component operates independently while contributing to a **unified ADHD risk assessment**.

### 🔄 High-Level Workflow
1. Children interact with **web-based tasks and games**
2. Multimodal data is captured (audio, video, gaze, handwriting)
3. Features are extracted and preprocessed
4. Machine learning models analyze behavioral patterns
5. Results are fused into an **ADHD risk score**
6. **Attention-improvement games** are recommended
